# System Specification — Platform-Independent Metamodel

A platform-independent metamodel for describing systems, components, capabilities, data, requirements, risks and verification. AI-driven development is one supported application, not a requirement.

**[Scope and authority](MODEL-SCOPE.md):** projects choose their development methodology, policies, verification criteria and enforcement. The reference implementation is optional, illustrative tooling—not a strict or authoritative validator.

## Overview

Implementations are not the source of truth — capabilities, invariants, contracts, data models, verification criteria, and formal models are. Each AI or engineering task operates on a bounded component slice (`--context`) validated across progressive lifecycle stages (`--stage`).

```text
Capability → Contract → Data Model → Verification → Implementation → Evidence
```

## Implementation-independent development lifecycle

The durable system definition is its capabilities, requirements, risks, contracts, invariants and verification obligations. Source code is a replaceable realization, not the specification's authority. Passing checks provides evidence for the behaviors and conditions they cover; it does not establish exhaustive behavioral completeness.

Two optional entry tracks converge on an accepted, reviewed specification:

- **Greenfield:** intended outcomes → behavioral contracts and risks → logical composition → verification design → implementation → evidence and acceptance.
- **Brownfield:** existing behavior and code → observed inventory → logical and behavioral characterization → explicit decisions about preserved versus corrected behavior → accepted specification. Scope maturity is recorded per slice, not automatically for the whole product.

After convergence, both use the [feature change workflow](FEATURE.md) for evolution, or the [replacement workflow](REPLACEMENT.md) to construct a new implementation without depending on the old source. The acceptance authority remains the consuming project. Architecture layers/domains and source/test organization are optional constraints, not intrinsic measures of behavioral conformance.

## Component isolation and replaceability

The optional [component isolation methodology](COMPONENT-ISOLATION.md) requires standalone execution with substituted dependencies and programmable mocks of provided capabilities. The opt-in reference check `--check-isolation --root <repo>` executes standalone harnesses and the same capability contract suite against the real and mock adapters. It checks declared bindings and executed outcomes, **not** complete semantic equivalence, security sandboxing or exhaustive scenario coverage.

## Standalone Components (Optional AI-Driven Workflow)

The following describes one reference methodology; adopting projects may choose different work boundaries, testing strategies and gates.

A component is the unit of work: it should be buildable and testable from its own `--context` slice, so an agent needs that slice, not the whole repository. The model supports this with explicit boundaries:

- `source_paths` and `test_paths` bind a component to its code and its own tests; test evidence must come from `test_paths` (`COMP-08`).
- Dependencies exist only through declared `requires` capabilities with interface contracts; `--check-drift` flags Python and JS/TS imports (source and tests) that bypass them.
- Each required capability has a fake under `test_paths` (`fakes`, `COMP-09`), and tests may not import other components (`--check-drift`), so tests run against fakes only; `test_scope: integration` exempts assembly/end-to-end tests, which may use providers of required capabilities.
- Platforms and third-party APIs are `external` components (`COMP-11`): contracts only, drawn outside the system; runtime-mediated dependencies name their mediator in `via`.
- A faked capability needs a verified `contract` requirement at its provider (`COMP-10`).
- Not enforced: that a fake matches the provider's contract tests, that a slice alone suffices to build the component, or that a provider publishes a programmable mock. See [component isolation](COMPONENT-ISOLATION.md).
- In the stricter component isolation methodology, providers publish configurable mocks of their own capabilities, consumers run against substitutes, and shared contract suites exercise real and mock adapters.

| Check | Command | Verifies | Does not verify |
|---|---|---|---|
| Metadata | `system-spec spec.yaml --stage <stage>` | Invariants for the stage, incl. `COMP-08` | Any file on disk |
| Isolation | `--check-isolation --root <repo>` | Standalone commands execute successfully, dependency substitutes exist, and shared real/mock contract suites pass | Hermetic isolation, untested scenarios or full behavioral equivalence |
| Artifacts | `--check-artifacts --root <repo>` | Declared source/test/schema paths exist, stay inside the root, and hashes match | Content correctness |
| Drift | `--check-drift --root <repo>` | Python and JS/TS imports vs `requires`/`bindings`; tests importing other components; JSON Schema properties vs model fields | Other languages/formats, field types |
| Compatibility | `--compat OLD.yaml` | Capability and data-model changes vs the old spec | Clause semantics |
| Plan | `--plan ID` | Provider-first waves of affected components, their bindings, requirements and evidence to revisit (no validation) | That the plan is sufficient |
| Export | `--export backstage\|structurizr` | One-way catalog / C4 workspace output from the spec | Round-tripping; ownership (Backstage `--owner` is a parameter) |
| Test report | `--check-report JUNIT` (repeatable) | Every test binds exactly one current requirement version (`verifies` property); `test` evidence matches the reports (present, same requirement, version and result). `--emit-evidence JUNIT` derives the records | That tests are meaningful or cover every criterion |
| Return | `--check-return FILE` | An implementer's handoff return covers every requirement of the component, versions are current, failures are unmet, changes stay in scope | That results are true or tests meaningful |
| Scope | `--check-scope COMPONENT --changed FILE\|-` | Changed paths stay inside the component's source/test/fake/owned-schema paths (path comparison only; `--allow` extras) | File contents, selector-based tests |
